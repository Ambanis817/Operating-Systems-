Description: Explored kernel-level programming concepts by modifying the Linux kernel and analyzing system performance.
Key Features:
Kernel Development: Configured and compiled a Linux kernel, added a custom system call, and used printk for diagnostics.
Producer-Consumer Queue: Implemented thread synchronization using condition variables and managed threads with create, join, and sleep functions.
Context Switching Analysis: Measured direct and indirect costs of context switches, including CPU cycles and cache misses.
